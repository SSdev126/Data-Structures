pa 7: BigIntegers

--------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION

 For this assignment we created a BigInteger ADT
 and used it with our existing List ADT to
 do arithmetic on extremely large integers


--------------------------------------------
FILES
-Arithmetic.c
-BigInteger.c
-BigInteger.h
-BigIntegerTest.c
-List.c
-List.h
-ListTest.c
-Makefile
-README

---------------------------------------------
NOTES
- keeps failing Arithmetic.c tests 3, 4, 5, 
  I believe this is because multiply is getting misaligned
  with the intended base. I'll keep testing but i doubt i'll manage it
  in time.
