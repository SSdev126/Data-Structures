pa 4: The perfect Shuffle

--------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION

 For this assignment, we created another doubly linked List ADT but this time we used C++
 rather than C. We then used that List adt to create a client program that found how many
 perfect shuffles it would take to get it back to its original state.
